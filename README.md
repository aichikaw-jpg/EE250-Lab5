Answer for Question 1: 
dBm is the unit of measurement for signal. A higher dBm means that the signal is stronger and better. These numbers are typically closer to zero. The weaker signals are typically - and a lot lower. 

Answer for Question 2:
The OS is important to know since each OS has a different format and if the format is not known, it programs may not work smoothly. MacOS and Linux uses similar commands like ls -l. However Windows uses different commands like instead of ls -l, it uses dir. 

Answer for Question 3:
subprocess.check_output runs a given command and returns its output. The return is the output of the given command or a CalledProcessError if something has gone wrong.

Answer for Question 4:
The re.search function searches for a given pattern in a string. It returns a match object. If there was no match, return None. 

Answer for Question 5:
dBm needs to be calculated because it represents the signal quality using a percentage value instead of dBm. 

Answer for Question 6:
The standard deviation is the amount of error that is possible between a value. It is important to know because it gives a range for what the actual value of a statistic is. 

Answer for Question 7:
A dataframe is a data structure that is a table. It is useful to use dataframe to store the data because it stores it in a single variable. Also it can contain different types of variables. 

Answer for Question 8:
It is important to plot the error bars so that we know how much error there may be in the data. It allows us to visualize how uncertain we may have to be about a data table. 

Answer for Question 9:
The plot showed that there wasn't a huge deviation even if I walked pretty far from the room. (I was connected to the ee250 wifi). I noticed that the weakest signal occured when I was at the stairs near the elevator. However, the signal was stronger when I went outside towards the armstrong statue and near the OHE fountain. Even though the distances were different, they had the same signal. I think the reason why could be that there are more walls that get in the way for the location at the stairs. However, for the fountain and armstrong statue, they have the same amount of walls blocking the signal.
